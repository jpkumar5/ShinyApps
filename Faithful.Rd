Old Failthful Geyser Data

\description{
Waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.
}

\details{
A closer look at faithful eruptions reveals that these are heavily rounded times originally in seconds, where multiples of 5 are more frequent than expected under non-human measurement. For a better version of the eruption times, see the example below.There are many versions of this dataset around: Azzalini and Bowman (1990) use a more complete version.
